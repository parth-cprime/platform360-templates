Description:
This file contains the `ValidationService`, which is responsible for validating user inputs, specifically the feedback form data. It uses the `joi` library to define a validation schema for the feedback object, specifying that the `name`, `email`, and `message` fields are required. The `validateFeedback` method validates the feedback data against the schema and throws an error if the validation fails.

These are the key files and components of the Customer Feedback Notification System. The project follows React best practices, implements security measures, and provides a basic structure for handling customer feedback and sending notifications. The code is organized into logical components and services, making it modular and maintainable.

Please note that this is a simplified version and may require additional enhancements and modifications based on the specific requirements of your project.
