# Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a responsive, high-conversion marketing page for a product/service. The primary goal is to effectively communicate the value proposition, drive user engagement, and convert visitors into qualified leads or customers. The page will feature sections such as a feature overview, customer testimonials, pricing options, FAQs, and trust indicators. It will also be integrated with a CRM and a marketing automation platform. 

The page will be SEO-optimized, mobile-responsive, and designed to load under three seconds. It will also feature A/B testing capabilities to optimize key page elements.

# Security Considerations

The security for this project is of medium level. The primary authentication method used will be JSON Web Tokens (JWT). All data used and transferred will be internal.

# Authentication Method

JWTs will be used for secure transmission of information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

# Data Sensitivity Level

The data sensitivity level for this project is internal. All data used and transferred will be strictly internal and will not be shared or made accessible to external parties.

# Installation Instructions

Detailed installation instructions will be provided in the INSTALL.md file.
