Based on the provided details, here's a sample secure React code implementation that addresses the security requirements, considers user experience insights, and follows the security template:

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import { AuthProvider } from './components/AuthContext';
import PrivateRoute from './components/PrivateRoute';
import Login from './pages/Login';
import Dashboard from './pages/Dashboard';

function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <Router>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/login" component={Login} />
          <PrivateRoute path="/" component={Dashboard} />
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}

export default App;

// AuthContext.js
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const AuthContext = createContext();

export function useAuth() {
  return useContext(AuthContext);
}

export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  function login(userData) {
    // Perform secure login logic
    // Validate user credentials securely
    // Issue JWT token upon successful authentication
    // Set user state
    setUser(userData);
  }

  function logout() {
    // Clear user state and JWT token
    setUser(null);
  }

  const value = {
    user,
    login,
    logout,
  };

  return <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</AuthContext.Provider>;
}

// PrivateRoute.js
import React from 'react';
import { Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';

function PrivateRoute({ component: Component, ...rest }) {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  return (
    <Route
      {...rest}
      render={(props) =>
        user ? (
          <Component {...props} />
        ) : (
          <Redirect
            to={{
              pathname: '/login',
              state: { from: props.location },
            }}
          />
        )
      }
    />
  );
}

export default PrivateRoute;

// Login.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '../components/AuthContext';

function Login() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const { login } = useAuth();

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Perform input validation
    // Sanitize and validate username and password
    // Call login function with validated credentials
    login({ username, password });
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Render login form */}
    </form>
  );
}

export default Login;

// Dashboard.js
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '../components/AuthContext';

function Dashboard() {
  const { user, logout } = useAuth();

  function handleLogout() {
    // Call logout function
    logout();
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.username}!</h1>
      <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>
      {/* Render dashboard content */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Dashboard;
```

Security Controls:
1. Input Validation: Implement input validation and sanitization for user inputs, such as username and password, to prevent injection attacks and handle malicious inputs.

2. Authentication: Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication. Upon successful login, issue a JWT token to the client and include it in subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

3. Authorization: Implement role-based access control to ensure users can only access resources they are authorized to. Use the `PrivateRoute` component to protect routes that require authentication.

4. Session Management: Store JWT token securely on the client-side (e.g., in an HTTP-only cookie or local storage) and include it in API requests to maintain session state.

5. Data Protection: Encrypt sensitive data, such as passwords, using strong encryption algorithms. Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text.

6. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and provide generic error messages to users to avoid exposing sensitive information.

7. Logging: Implement secure logging mechanisms to track user actions and detect suspicious activities. Avoid logging sensitive data.

8. API Security: Secure API endpoints by implementing rate limiting, input validation, and authentication/authorization checks.

9. Dependency Security: Regularly update and patch dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix security issues in dependencies.

10. Infrastructure Security: Deploy the application on a secure infrastructure with proper network security, access controls, and monitoring in place.

To address the identified user experience issues:
- Investigate the cause of dead clicks and optimize the user interface to reduce friction and improve the overall experience.
- Analyze the sessions with the lowest experience scores to identify specific pain points and address them in the implementation.
- Utilize the heatmap data to optimize the placement of important elements and improve user engagement.

Security Documentation:
- Document the implemented security controls, including input validation, authentication, authorization, and data protection measures.
- Provide guidelines for secure configuration and deployment of the application.
- Include instructions for secure handling of secrets, such as JWT secret key and database credentials.

Security Testing Plan:
- Perform regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to secure coding practices and identify any security flaws.
- Perform manual testing to validate the effectiveness of implemented security controls and identify any gaps.

Note: The provided code snippet is a simplified example and may require further modifications and enhancements based on the specific requirements of the application. It is crucial to thoroughly test and validate the security of the implemented solution.
