Invalid username or password.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static boolean authenticateUser(String username, String password) {\n        // Perform basic authentication logic\n        // This is a simplified example, in a real application, you would typically\n        // compare the provided credentials against a user database or authentication service\n        return username.equals(\"admin\") && password.equals(\"password\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```java SecurityUtils.java\nimport java.security.MessageDigest;\nimport java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;\n\npublic class SecurityUtils {\n    public static String hashPassword(String password) {\n        try {\n            // Create an instance of SHA-256 message digest\n            MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");\n            // Convert the password to bytes and compute the hash\n            byte[] hash = digest.digest(password.getBytes());\n            // Convert the hash to a hexadecimal string representation\n            StringBuilder hexString = new StringBuilder();\n            for (byte b : hash) {\n                String hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff & b);\n                if (hex.length() == 1) {\n                    hexString.append('0');\n                }\n                hexString.append(hex);\n            }\n            return hexString.toString();\n        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {\n            // Handle the exception if SHA-256 algorithm is not available\n            e.printStackTrace();\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `Main` class contains the main method, which prompts the user for a username and password using a `Scanner`.\n- The `authenticateUser` method performs basic authentication by comparing the provided username and password against hardcoded values. In a real application, you would typically compare against a user database or authentication service.\n- The `SecurityUtils` class provides a `hashPassword` method that uses SHA-256 to hash the password. This is a basic security measure to avoid storing passwords in plain text. However, for low security requirements and public data sensitivity, this may be sufficient.\n- Error handling is done using a try-catch block in the `hashPassword` method to handle the case where the SHA-256 algorithm is not available.\n- The code follows Java naming conventions and includes comments to explain the purpose of each method and important sections of the code.\n- The sensitive data (password) is not stored in plain text but is hashed using SHA-256. However, for public data sensitivity and low security requirements, additional encryption may not be necessary.\n\nNote: This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. In a real application, you would need to consider additional security measures, proper error handling, logging, and follow industry best practices based on the specific requirements and security needs of your application."
