import api from './api';

export default {
  async getAll() {
    return api.get('/orders');
  },
  
  async get(id) {  
    return api.get(`/orders/${id}`);
  },
  
  async create(order) {
    return api.post('/orders', order);  
  },
  
  async update(order) {
    return api.put(`/orders/${order.id}`, order);
  },
  
  async remove(id) {  
    return api.delete(`/orders/${id}`);
  },
};

This covers the key parts of a basic React project structure with secure authentication and API integration. Additional components, pages, styling, error handling, etc would be added as the application is built out further. The API service methods handle the CRUD operations and the PrivateRoute component protects access to authenticated pages. Proper security measures like HTTPS, secure cookies, validation, rate limiting are assumed to be handled by the backend API.

Let me know if you would like me to expand on any part of the implementation!
