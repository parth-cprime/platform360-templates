# Order Management API

This project implements an Order Management API using Node.js. It provides endpoints for managing orders and includes security features such as JWT authentication, rate limiting, and input validation.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code
  - `controllers/`: API route handlers
  - `middlewares/`: Custom middleware functions
  - `models/`: Data models and schemas
  - `routes/`: API route definitions
  - `services/`: Business logic and data access
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
  - `app.js`: Main application entry point
  - `config.js`: Configuration settings
- `tests/`: Contains test files
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts
- `.env`: Environment variables

## Key Components

- `app.js`: Sets up the Express application, middleware, and routes
- `controllers/`: Defines the API route handlers
- `middlewares/`: Implements custom middleware for authentication, error handling, etc.
- `models/`: Defines the data models and schemas using Mongoose
- `routes/`: Defines the API routes and maps them to the corresponding controllers
- `services/`: Contains the business logic and data access functions
- `utils/`: Provides utility functions for tasks like password hashing and token generation

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env` file
4. Start the server: `npm start`
5. Run tests: `npm test`

## Security Considerations

- JWT authentication is used to secure the API endpoints
- Rate limiting middleware is implemented to prevent abuse
- Input validation is performed using Joi schemas
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database
- CORS is configured to restrict access to allowed origins
- Helmet middleware is used to add security headers
