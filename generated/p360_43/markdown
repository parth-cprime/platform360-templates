# Order Management API

This project implements an Order Management API using React. It follows secure coding practices and implements features for managing orders.

## Project Overview
The Order Management API allows users to perform CRUD operations on orders. It includes authentication using JWT tokens and follows security best practices to protect sensitive data.

## Folder Structure
- `/src` - Contains the main source code files
  - `/controllers` - Handles API endpoints and request processing
  - `/models` - Defines data models and schemas
  - `/services` - Implements business logic and data manipulation
  - `/utils` - Contains utility functions and helpers
- `/tests` - Contains test files for unit and integration testing
- `/config` - Holds configuration files for the application
- `/public` - Contains static assets and public files

## Key Components
- `app.js` - The main entry point of the application
- `orderController.js` - Handles order-related API endpoints
- `orderModel.js` - Defines the order data model and schema
- `orderService.js` - Implements business logic for managing orders
- `authMiddleware.js` - Middleware for authentication and authorization
- `validationMiddleware.js` - Middleware for input validation

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables in `.env` file
4. Start the application: `npm start`
5. Access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:3000`

## Security Considerations
- Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing in the database
- Input validation is performed using Joi library
- API endpoints are protected with authentication middleware
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse and protect against DoS attacks
- CORS is configured to restrict access from allowed origins only
- Sensitive data is not logged or exposed in error messages
