# Order Management API

The Order Management API is a secure Java-based API for managing customer orders. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting orders, with authentication and authorization implemented using OAuth.

## Project Overview

The API follows a modular structure and separates concerns into distinct components such as controllers, services, and models. It adheres to Java code standards, including best practices, naming conventions, documentation, error handling, and SOLID principles.

## Folder Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main Java source code
  - `com.example.ordermanagement`: Base package
    - `config`: Configuration classes
    - `controller`: API controllers
    - `model`: Data models
    - `repository`: Data access repositories
    - `security`: Security-related classes
    - `service`: Business logic services
- `src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files
- `src/test/java`: Contains unit and integration tests

## Key Components

- `OrderController`: Handles HTTP requests for order-related operations
- `OrderService`: Implements business logic for order management
- `Order`: Represents the order data model
- `SecurityConfig`: Configures security settings and authentication
- `JwtTokenProvider`: Generates and validates JWT tokens for authentication

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/example/order-management-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd order-management-api`
3. Build the project: `./mvnw clean install`
4. Run the application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

## Security Considerations

The API implements security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure authorized access only. It follows security best practices, including:

- OAuth authentication with JWT tokens
- Input validation and error handling
- Secure communication over HTTPS
- Proper authentication and authorization checks
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Regular security updates and patches

Please refer to the code and inline comments for more details on the security implementation.
