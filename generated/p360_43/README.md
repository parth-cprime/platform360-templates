# Order Management API

## Project Overview
This project is a customer service notification system that automatically analyzes incoming feedback for urgent keywords or negative sentiment and routes notifications to the appropriate team member. This system is built using React and provides a high level of security fitting for internal data sensitivity.

## Security Considerations
Security is a crucial aspect of this project. We have:
1. Implemented proper JWT token validation
2. Used secure password hashing
3. Enabled CORS with proper configuration
4. Implemented rate limiting
5. Used security headers
6. Encrypted sensitive data
7. Implemented proper error handling
8. Used secure session management
9. Validated all input data
10. Implemented proper logging

## Authentication Method
This project uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. We use it to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.

## Data Sensitivity Level
The data sensitivity level for this project is classified as "internal". It means that the data used and processed in this project is intended for internal use and should not be disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.

## Installation Instructions
Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the application. Make sure to set up the necessary environment variables in a `.env` file in the project root.

## Security Best Practices Followed
We followed a number of security best practices in this project:
1. React security best practices
2. Using environment variables for sensitive data
3. Proper error handling
4. Using TypeScript for type safety
5. Comprehensive testing
6. Proper logging
7. Followed the principle of least privilege
8. Implemented secure session management
9. Used secure communication protocols
10. Regular security updates
