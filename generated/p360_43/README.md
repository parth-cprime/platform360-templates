# P360 Order Management API

## Project Overview
This project provides an API for the P360 order management system. It includes features such as analyzing incoming feedback for urgent keywords or negative sentiment, routing notifications based on feedback category, allowing team members to acknowledge notifications, and providing a dashboard showing pending and acknowledged urgent feedback.

## Security Considerations
1. Proper JWT token validation is implemented to ensure secure authentication.
2. We use secure password hashing.
3. CORS is enabled with proper configuration to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
4. Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute force attacks.
5. Security headers are used to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks.
6. Sensitive data is encrypted.
7. Proper error handling is put in place to prevent information disclosure.
8. Session management is securely implemented.
9. All input data is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
10. Security logging is used to detect and respond to security incidents.

## Authentication Method
We use JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication. JWT is a widely adopted open standard that allows transmitting data between parties as a JSON object in a secure manner. 

## Data Sensitivity Level
The data sensitivity level is internal. Access to the data is restricted to authorized internal users only.

## Installation Instructions
To install the project, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the project from the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up the required environment variables.
4. Run the project using `npm start`.

## Security Best Practices Followed
1. Security by design: Security was a consideration from the beginning of the project.
2. Principle of least privilege: Users are only given the permissions they need to perform their tasks.
3. Input validation: All user input is validated and sanitized.
4. Password security: Passwords are hashed using a strong algorithm.
5. Secure transmission: All data is transmitted over secure protocols.
6. Error handling: Errors are properly handled and do not reveal any sensitive information.
7. Security updates: The project's dependencies are regularly updated to include the latest security patches.
