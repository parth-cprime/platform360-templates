# Order Management API

## Project Overview
This Order Management API is designed to provide an automated system for notifying the customer service team when customer feedback requiring immediate attention is submitted. It includes features like analyzing incoming feedback, routing notifications to the appropriate team member, and maintaining a dashboard of pending and acknowledged urgent feedback.

## Security Considerations
We have considered the following security practices while designing this API:
1. JWT Token Validation for secure authentication.
2. Input Validation and Sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
3. Secure Password Hashing using bcrypt.
4. CORS enabled with proper configuration to prevent unauthorized access.
5. Error Handling to prevent information leakage.
6. Secure Logging for monitoring and audit purposes.

## Authentication Method
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used as the authentication method for this API.

## Data Sensitivity Level
The data sensitivity level for this API is internal.
