# Order Management API

## Project Overview
This project is an order management API. It provides automatic analysis of incoming feedback for keywords or negative sentiment, routing notifications to the appropriate team member based on the feedback category, allowing team members to acknowledge receipt of notifications, and a simple dashboard showing pending and acknowledged urgent feedback.

## Security Considerations
We have implemented a number of security measures including proper JWT token validation, secure password hashing, CORS configuration, rate limiting, security headers, encryption of sensitive data, proper error handling, secure session management, validation of all input data, and proper logging.

## Authentication Method
This API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. 

## Data Sensitivity Level
The data handled by this API is considered to be of internal sensitivity.
