# Order Management API

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of an Order Management API. It provides an interface for handling customer feedback and automatically sends notifications to the appropriate customer service team member when urgent feedback is received. The system is designed to prioritize responses to urgent issues to improve customer satisfaction.

## Security Considerations
The system is developed with a focus on security. It uses JWT for authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain endpoints. All input data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks. In addition, the system uses secure session management, proper error handling, and security logging.

## Authentication Method
The system uses JWT (Json Web Tokens) for authentication. This provides a secure and reliable method for validating user identities and protecting sensitive data.

## Data Sensitivity Level
The data handled by this system is considered to be of medium sensitivity. It includes customer feedback and internal user data. All sensitive data is encrypted and securely stored.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the project repository
2. Install the necessary dependencies
3. Set up the database
4. Configure the necessary environment variables
5. Run the application

1. Implementing proper JWT token validation
2. Using Spring Security for authentication
3. Enabling CORS with proper configuration
4. Implementing rate limiting
5. Using security headers
6. Encrypting sensitive data
7. Implementing proper error handling
8. Using secure session management
9. Validating all input data
10. Implementing proper logging
