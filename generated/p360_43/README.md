# Project Overview

This is an order management API for P360's customer service team. It includes an automated notification system that alerts the appropriate team member when customer feedback requiring immediate attention is submitted. The system analyzes incoming feedback for urgency and routes notifications based on the feedback category. Team members can acknowledge receipt of notifications, and a simple dashboard shows pending and acknowledged feedback.

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper JWT token validation
- Use secure password hashing
- Enable CORS with proper configuration
- Implement rate limiting
- Use security headers
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement proper error handling
- Use secure session management
- Validate all input data
- Implement proper logging

## Authentication Method

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

## Data Sensitivity Level

The data sensitivity level is internal.
