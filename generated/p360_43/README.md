# Order Management API

## Project Overview
This project provides an Order Management API which automatically analyzes incoming feedback for urgent keywords or negative sentiment, routes notifications to the appropriate team member based on the feedback category, allows team members to acknowledge receipt of notifications, and provides a simple dashboard showing pending and acknowledged urgent feedback.

## Security Considerations
- Implement JWT token validation for secure authentication
- Enable CORS with proper configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- Use Helmet for secure HTTP headers
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- Encrypt sensitive data to ensure data privacy
- Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement security logging to monitor for potential security threats

## Authentication Method
This project uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. 

## Data Sensitivity Level
The data handled by this application is classified as internal.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the project repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set environment variables as per the `.env.example` file
4. Run `npm start` to start the application

## Security Best Practices Followed
- All sensitive data is stored in environment variables
- Proper error handling is implemented to prevent information leakage
- All inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Security headers are set with Helmet
- CORS is enabled with proper configuration
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute-force attacks
- Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- JWT tokens are securely validated
- Security logging is implemented
- Principle of least privilege is followed in access controls
