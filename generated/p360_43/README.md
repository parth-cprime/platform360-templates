# Order Management API

## Project Overview
This project is an Order Management API which provides an automated notification system for a customer service team. It analyzes incoming feedback for urgency and directs notifications to the appropriate team member. It also provides a simple dashboard showing pending and acknowledged urgent feedback.

## Security Considerations
We've implemented the following security measures:
1. JWT token validation for secure authentication
2. CORS enabled with proper configuration
3. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Security headers via Helmet middleware
5. Encryption of sensitive data
6. Proper error handling to prevent information leaks
7. Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks

## Authentication Method
We're using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. This method is stateless and scalable, allowing for secure data transfer between parties.

## Data Sensitivity Level
The data handled by this API is considered internal. It's important to protect this data against unauthorized access or modification.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the project repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set your environment variables in a `.env` file
4. Start the server with `npm start`

## Security Best Practices Followed
1. Least Privilege Principle: Every module can access only the information and resources necessary for its legitimate purpose.
2. Regular Updates: Dependencies are kept up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.
3. Secure Defaults: Configuration settings are set to secure values by default.
4. Encryption: Sensitive data is encrypted during transit and at rest.
5. Logging: All actions are logged for audit purposes.
6. Error Handling: Errors are properly handled and do not disclose sensitive information.
