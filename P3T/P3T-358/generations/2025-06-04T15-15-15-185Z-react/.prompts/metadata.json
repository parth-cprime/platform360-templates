Use the PROJECT STRUCTURE TEMPLATE as your guide for organizing all code files\n2. Implement ALL the SECURITY REQUIREMENTS appropriate for the specified security level\n3. Include comprehensive error handling, logging, and exception management\n4. Add detailed comments explaining complex logic and important decisions\n5. Implement unit tests for critical functionality\n6. Follow best practices for the specified language and framework\n7. Use modern, clean coding patterns with proper separation of concerns\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT just provide implementation instructions or placeholder comments. \nI need COMPLETE, WORKING code with full implementations that can be saved and run.\n\nFILE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\nFor each file, provide a clear file path followed by the code content in this format:\n\n```\nFile: src/path/to/filename.extension\n```\n\n```react\n// Full file content here\n```\n\nEnsure each filename is a valid path (e.g., src/components/Auth.tsx) and includes the appropriate extension. \nDo not use descriptions as filenames.
