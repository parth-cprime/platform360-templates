You can then use the `useAuth` hook in your components to access the current user and the login/logout functions.

For error handling, you can use a combination of try/catch blocks in your service functions and an error boundary component in your React component tree. 

Remember to validate user inputs both client-side (for better user experience) and server-side (for security). 

Lastly, remember to split your code into small, reusable components and follow good practices such as using PropTypes for props validation, keeping your components pure when possible, and testing your components and functions.
