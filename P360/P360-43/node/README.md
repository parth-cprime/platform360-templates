# P360 sample business requirement task

## Project Overview
Create a order management API where itBackground

The customer service team currently receives feedback through a web form, but has no automated way to be notified when urgent issues are reported. Team members must regularly check the system, causing delays in addressing time-sensitive customer concerns.

h2. Business Requirement

Create a notification system that alerts the appropriate customer service team member when customer feedback requiring immediate attention is submitted.

h2. Key Features

# Automatically analyze incoming feedback for urgent keywords or negative sentiment
# Route notifications to the appropriate team member based on the feedback category
# Allow team members to acknowledge receipt of notifications
# Provide a simple dashboard showing pending and acknowledged urgent feedback

h2. Success Criteria

* Urgent feedback notifications are sent within 2 minutes of submission
* Team members acknowledge receipt of 95% of urgent notifications within 15 minutes during business hours
* Customer satisfaction for urgent issues improves by 10% within three months is fetching
