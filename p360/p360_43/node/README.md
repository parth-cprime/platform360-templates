## Technical Stack
- Programming Language: node
- Frameworks: Express
- Database: MongoDB
- External Services: None

## Architecture
The system is built on Node.js using the Express framework. It uses MongoDB as the database to store feedback and notification records. The sentiment analysis is done using a built-in utility. Notifications are routed based on predefined rules.
