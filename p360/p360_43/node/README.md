# Order Management API

## Business Requirements
### Task Overview
- **Task ID**: P360-43
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: To Do

### Requirements
This project aims to create an order management API that serves as a notification system for the customer service team. The main problem that it addresses is the lack of an automated way for the team to be notified when urgent issues are reported. As a result, team members must regularly check the system, causing delays in addressing time-sensitive customer concerns.

### Key Features
1. Automatically analyze incoming feedback for urgent keywords or negative sentiment
2. Route notifications to the appropriate team member based on the feedback category
3. Allow team members to acknowledge receipt of notifications
4. Provide a simple dashboard showing pending and acknowledged urgent feedback

### Success Criteria
1. Urgent feedback notifications are sent within 2 minutes of submission
2. Team members acknowledge receipt of 95% of urgent notifications within 15 minutes during business hours
3. Customer satisfaction for urgent issues improves by 10% within three months

## Overview
This project is an order management API that acts as a notification system. It is intended to be used by the customer service team to quickly and efficiently handle urgent customer issues reported through web forms.

## Technical Stack
- Programming Language: Node.js
- Frameworks: Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- External Services: None

## Architecture
This application is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into different parts of the application:
- Controllers: Handle incoming requests and send responses
- Models: Define data structures
- Routes: Define API endpoints
- Services: Handle business logic
- Middleware: Handle tasks such as authentication and error handling
- Config: Contains configuration settings
- Utils: Contains utility functions such as logging and data validation

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js v12.18.2 or later
- MongoDB v4.4.1 or later
- A JWT_SECRET environment variable for JWT authentication

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies
3. Start your MongoDB server
4. Run `npm start` to start the application server

### Configuration
- Set the JWT_SECRET environment variable to a secure, random string
- Set the MONGODB_URI environment variable to your MongoDB connection string

## Development
### Building the Project
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Project
```bash
npm start
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment
### Prerequisites
- A server with Node.js and MongoDB installed
- A secure way to store environment variables

### Deployment Steps
1. Push your code to a Git repository
2. On your server, clone the repository
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Set your environment variables
5. Run `npm start` to start the application server

## Security
### Authentication
This application uses JWT for authentication. Users must log in to receive a token that they must provide in the Authorization header of their requests.

### Authorization
This application uses role-based authorization. Some endpoints are only accessible by users with certain roles.

### Data Protection
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database. Sensitive data is encrypted using the aes-256-cbc algorithm.

## API Documentation
### Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| /api/protected | GET | Returns a message if the user is authenticated |

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- **Issue**: JWT token is missing or invalid
  - **Solution**: Make sure you are providing a valid JWT token in the Authorization header of your requests
- **Issue**: Database connection failed
  - **Solution**: Check your MongoDB connection string and ensure that your MongoDB server is running
