# Order Management API

## Business Requirements
### Task Overview
- **Task ID**: P360-43
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: To Do

### Requirements
The customer service team currently receives feedback through a web form, but has no automated way to be notified when urgent issues are reported. Team members must regularly check the system, causing delays in addressing time-sensitive customer concerns.

We need a notification system that alerts the appropriate customer service team member when customer feedback requiring immediate attention is submitted.

The key features required are:
- Automatically analyze incoming feedback for urgent keywords or negative sentiment
- Route notifications to the appropriate team member based on the feedback category
- Allow team members to acknowledge receipt of notifications
- Provide a simple dashboard showing pending and acknowledged urgent feedback

### Success Criteria
- Urgent feedback notifications are sent within 2 minutes of submission
- Team members acknowledge receipt of 95% of urgent notifications within 15 minutes during business hours
- Customer satisfaction for urgent issues improves by 10% within three months

## Overview
This project is a Java-based API to manage order processing and customer feedback. Customer service agents can receive notifications of urgent feedback, acknowledge receipt, and track feedback through a dashboard.

## Technical Stack
- Programming Language: Java
- Frameworks: Spring Boot, Spring Security
- Database: MySQL
- External Services: None

## Architecture
The project is based on a monolithic architecture using Spring Boot. It follows the MVC design pattern and uses Spring Security for authentication and authorization. The data is stored in a MySQL database.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Java 8
- Maven
- MySQL

## Security
### Authentication
JWT authentication is used. Users need to authenticate with a username and password to receive a JWT token.

### Authorization
Uses Spring Security's role-based authorization. Different endpoints require different roles.

### Data Protection
Sensitive data is encrypted before being stored in the database.
