};

### Additional Files
For a complete implementation, you would also include TypeScript interfaces/types in `src/types/`, custom React hooks in `src/hooks/`, and any additional utility functions in `src/utils/`. However, given the simplicity of this app and the focus on adding two numbers, these additional structures are not explicitly required here. The provided files and code snippets form a complete, deployable Forge app that meets the outlined requirements.
